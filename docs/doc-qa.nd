# DocumentQA

This example demonstrates using the DocumentQAQA tool to answer questions about documents.

```python
from vision_agent_tools.tools.doc_qa import DocumentQA

# (replace this path with your own!) 
test_image = "path/to/your/document.jpg"
document = Image.open(test_image)

# also works with pdf files (replace this path with your own)
document = "path/to/your/document.pdf"

# Initialize DocumentQA model
run_document_qa = DocumentQA()

# Time to put DocumentQA to work! Let's pose a question about the document
answer = run_document_qa(document, question="What is the hottest day of the year?")

# Print the output answer
print(answer)
```
